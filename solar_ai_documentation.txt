Solar Industry AI Assistant - Documentation

Project Overview

The Solar Industry AI Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide insights into the solar energy industry. It utilizes a Hugging Face model (Falcon-7B-Instruct) to generate accurate and informative responses regarding solar panels, installation, maintenance, costs, regulations, and trends.

Features

1. LLM-based AI Assistant using Hugging Face Transformers.

2. Customizable Settings (response temperature, max length).

3. User-friendly Web Interface built with Streamlit.

4. Error Handling & Robust Performance.

5. Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces or locally.

Example Conversations

User: "How do solar panels work?"

AI: "Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. These cells generate a direct current (DC), which is then converted to alternating current (AC) by an inverter for home or industrial use."

User: "What are the latest trends in solar energy?"

AI: "Recent trends include the rise of bifacial solar panels, improved battery storage technology, floating solar farms, and AI-driven solar grid optimization."


Future Improvements

1. Multilingual Support

2. oice Input & Response

3. Integration with Solar Market APIs

4. Enhanced Context Retention

5. User Authentication & Personalization




Conclusion

The Solar Industry AI Assistant is a scalable and deployable project designed to educate and assist users in understanding solar energy. Future iterations can further enhance its capabilities by integrating more advanced AI features and expanding its dataset.
